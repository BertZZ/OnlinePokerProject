The Project
-----------

The project started as a slightly ambitious Online poker game. However we quickly realised this would not be possible in a week whilst also writing a poker hand checker from scratch. The app we have built we feel could be used for generating realistic poker hands to assist learning in a risk free environment, alongside other Poker learning reasorces.
