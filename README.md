# Online Poker Project

Written as part of the course at Makers Academy. 

To Start
---------

```
npm install
nodemon
```

The Project
-----------

The project started as a slightly ambitious Online poker game. However we quickly realised this would not be possible in a week whilst also writing a poker hand checker from scratch. The app we have built we feel could be used for generating realistic poker hands to assist learning in a risk free environment, alongside other Poker learning reasorces. 

Technologies
------------
We wrote the project in Javascript with Node, Express and Angular

Testing
--------
We used Mocha/Chai and Zombie for testing
